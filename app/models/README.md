my_model.h5 is a keras model of inception v3 architecture transfer-trained with
Kaggle dataset: [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

Performance of the model with test data:
- recall = 0.94 (ratio of predicted pneumonia cases from true pneumonia cases)
- precision = 0.71 (ratio of true pneumonia cases in predicted pneumonia cas  

Since Github does not allow uploading any file > 25mb, my_model.h5 was split into 4 zip files.
